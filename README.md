[Link to the E-Commerce Store](https://clone-e2868.web.app/)

This Amazon Clone is the first fully functional E-Commerce Store that I made with React

## Page Structure (SPA)

- / = Homepage

- /login = Sign(in/up) Page _Fully functional thanks to the firebase provided backend functionalities_

- /checkout = Basket Page _Prices and number of items updates dynamically thanks to the context api_

- /payment = Checkout Page _Integrated stripe payment functionality_

- /orders = Previously ordered products recap

# Technologies I used

**CSS - Responsive - BEM Convention**
**React - contextAPI - useState/Effect - React Router**
**Npm - Moment Axios Stripe material-ui currencyformat**
**Firebase - hosting and functions for front and back end deployment**
